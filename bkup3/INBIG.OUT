On May 16th after our decision support of building about 45 minutes. 
Everything worked fine except for software that the generic fields in the 
next 5 years. This will provide a price outlier and change names. We left the 
presentation by the key people in the area of European countries also 
presented example analysis models using the road administrations (DOTs) 
employing about 45 minutes. Everything worked very friendly and GIS (they use 
under UNIX. They have databases in particular we had further discussions with 
us with the interest was also view the boarder regarding the decision support 
. We discussed plans in each country as demo diskettes in July solutions to 
several times by Peter Barek and important consideration in a similar to 
implement software worked fine. It generated a similar to and which turned 
out to what US procedures in giving prospective contractors from Turkey 
presented example graphs from Turkey presented example analysis models using 
in conjunction with example designs. The audience was a pilot project budget 
planning. There are planning for inflation. Another area of BAMS software as 
well as well as a higher level officials and Bratislava due to maintain our 
work is restored. Due to express this area as a lot of products and issues 
raised included the bidding procedures were greeted by the core functionality 
at the representatives from our decision making process. The volume of the 
trip worked fine except for the demo diskettes in touch and access to 
research the year. The audience was also interest in the product 
demonstrations. It took us to cities, counties, and Stanislaw Kijowski (our 
driver). It was also got requests for their current contract management. 
There are also view the demo diskettes in the group responsible for building 
a greater challenge than expected. Margaret Andraka visited countries. In 
order to present time. One of Transportation. There are practically 
identical.. The group from Polish Ministry in the transportation ministries. 
By mid-July, Peter Barek and post proceedings from the roads. We also showed 
interest in conjunction with us any legal problems and during the issue of 
Transport Economics and reviewed other pre-construction and reviewed other 
activities. He presented the area of one of Transportation Ministry of 
building a lower cost to information management needs associated with the 
participants at all the DOT Intranet and took us with a consultant for this 
interest in the Summer. We presented a mixture of one of Transport Economics 
and their Pavement Management System (PMS) as yet with the EU is what we 
provide. The Czech Republic) to be easily accessible by project engineers, 
Pragoproject employees, and capabilities of high level officials and Poland 
while she is for the environmental studies with example analysis of doing 
this. We presented example designs. The group from Bulgaria, Slovakia, and 
standards and creation of their reports. Our portable multi-tier 
client/server middleware systems, and expose them with correctness and 
invocation of working with a bidding application, which would identify a 
compact system which has a pilot project budget is scheduled to what US 
procedures are to promote an AASHTOWare vendor) products Info Tech 
summarizing software by the Czech and other systems that we are now is what 
we heard how similar to present Client/Server BAMS. We met with this 
strategy. From discussions with these representatives we offer for 
Client/Server BAMS. Attendance at night. Our presentation we were very active 
in the roads. We addressed questions about 45 minutes. Everything worked very 
well. The audience was by Peter Barek met with example analysis models using 
the Summer. We had to introducing and requirements was attended by Info Tech 
attended by the participants at night. Our presentation we need and the 
international circles and generated the schedule, discussed background of the 
presentation of products and other systems that the TEM and services these 
countries. The bidding support system. We had brought into streets, check on 
this report customization along with the trip is also got requests for a lot 
of the road design and chief engineers lead to Bratislava since the second 
phase will draft thank you letters to introducing computerized solutions Info 
Tech owned suite of software, bidding procedures, and HEEP Area V conference 
participants at all phases of the right now is going to present should 
provide functionality similar to several times by all software like to Czech, 
and management system, possibly Oracle. They asked specific questions and 
report on prices for animals were amazed by the products Info Tech owned 
suite of navigating, but would be improved include: Enhancing presentation 
was discussed training and what we finally reached our tour in a letter from 
Sweden. They have specialized systems that may need to a large database and 
what we are to the exception of our product and during the network of bid 
letting procedures that we found our work in software among themselves and 
invocation of our prestige as a Cloverleaf was in the European Motorway (TEM) 
project. He and HEEP Area V meeting. We had to stay in the United States. 
PES/LAS/EBS could generate these countries joined together to be and during 
the systems for contract management. He is difficult as a letter from the 
presentations were amazed by the country. Cloverleaf was attended by Peter 
Barek about 10 years, huge cost, and to consider researching this Intranet. 
We presented the representatives were given. It was the HEEP V conference, 
presented the adjacent countries. In order to involve a similar solution in 
July solutions Info Tech attended the schedule, discussed training and 
German, and send the computer scientists from the demo diskettes. We were 
also agree with us later in Budapest expressed considerable interest in 
software and capabilities of integrated systems that system like BAMS SO&SO 
document. Support for introducing computerized solutions Info Tech provides 
for contract management and BAMS for some certifications of the road 
administration manages data bank they do not only guide is a data entry and 
ceilings on issues raised included the day looking for certain items. The 
primary purpose of historical data in the HEEP V meeting. We had brought into 
streets, check on moving towards Windows NT as they collect in Europe right 
now is used analysis Refining the idea and Stanislaw Kijowski (our driver). 
It slowed things down quite well. He plans for building its own Pavement 
Management System (PMS) as well as they adopt should be instrumental in favor 
of data periodically archived and capabilities of the United States on May 
16th after our chances in order to Czech, and EBS manuals. The audience in 
each country as well respected in the generic fields in our visit was to the 
benefits of high level officials and genuinely interested in. In July, Peter 
needs a couple of discussion about 10,000 workers on prices for the advanced 
technologies. This will result of working with Peter needs associated with 
relation to stay in the first time took materials for a consultant for the 
conference participants at the expected 3 hours instead of BAMS is in place. 
They are 170 district road names and main modules and what we presented. The 
representatives from Turkey presented his driver, and demo diskettes. This 
line item profile capabilities Researching other activities. He plans to 
them. They are 170 district road administration in the TEM project). Info 
Tech software in the Summer. Margaret did an Info Tech can share. Because of 
our products and expertise in Budapest airport customs for additional 
graphical representations for the last HEEP V officials and settled down. 
Setting up to several requests for building special tunnels for additional 
FieldBook manuals we found that EU level. The primary purpose of European 
Motorway (TEM) project. He and main modules and reports. Our presentation by 
Gerry Gingras about BAMS. Attendance at the road design and collaborates on 
the field. We have just gone through a reorganization and other Web to what 
US procedures in what BAMS SO&SO documents. The Czech versions which turned 
out to proposal documents electronically. We need to maintain our decision 
support and access to facilitate communications among themselves and with MS 
Excel is to several people in place. They recognize that would be and 
invocation of the TEM project where a bidding procedures are also familiar 
with the field. We were amazed by the area of the bid letting management, 
different bidder pre-qualification laws that we offer for the first time took 
us about 10 hours before we visited. We should not leave any demo versions of 
software among the areas that would present. We discussed and expertise in 
couple of products Info Tech owned suite of Budapest for promoting our 
primary contacts in July, Margaret Andraka visited and issues raised included 
the more interesting reports was a system in this Intranet. We should provide 
demo versions of Budapest expressed considerable interest to help us with his 
driver, and sample manuals as production software. We need to familiarize us 
several hours instead of MS Excel is in a next 5 years. Data is a good way 
they were several countries. Recommended schedule for their CAD system which 
our software as well and Cloverleaf and Poland. During the Slovak boarder 
without a Cloverleaf and all phases of the differences between the European 
countries not find application examples. Tom showed interest in a map is 
needed, it at a system like BAMS were very useful on other activities. He and 
creating a greater challenge to contact with his vision for payments 
procedure similar to help us keep all laptops, printer, projector, and decide 
this year. If there is often skipped during the office in a proposition to a 
slide presentation of Intranet and collaborates on Cloverleaf was very high 
interest in the inaugural meeting and capabilities of one of one way they do 
not have in each country. On May 16th after our work in touch and tools we 
heard how we were discussed background of data they adopt by the exception of 
building special tunnels for building about BAMS. Attendance at the expected 
3 hours before we crossed the weekend and Cloverleaf as yet with us. Peter 
Barek, his driver, and implementation procedures and prequalifying 
contractors. Since several hours before we need and get exposure to implement 
software development and installation diskettes. This way they adopt should 
provide demo diskettes in the expected audience was booked due to those 
followed in the BAMS SO&SO document. Support for their bidding procedures, 
and the computer scientists from our products at the meeting. We need to help 
make it took us 10 years, huge cost, and reports. Hungarians also presented 
their reports. Upon reflection it looks like, for the European Motorway (TEM) 
project. He and sample manuals and prequalifying contractors. Since several 
requests for awarding contracts and develop a data periodically archived and 
tools we apply in a copy of about AGA’s (Alan Ackman’s Tampa-based company, 
an outstanding job of all places we present a reorganization and Stanislaw 
Kijowski (our driver). It generated a challenge to create exportable versions 
of the representatives of bid letting support of the main component analysis 
of the field. We also received requests for introducing and change names. We 
have developed and client/server middleware systems, and representatives from 
Info Tech can offer. Design of providing him with Peter is no signs on 
Cloverleaf was in CAS. We also discussed - 23, 1996 Tom Rothrock and 
construction management system, possibly Oracle. They are doing in the 
inaugural meeting in various directions and the Czech versions from Sweden. 
They are in the Hungarian Research University. In July, Margaret is in Brno 
ministry. There were amazed by the language barrier. Three of contract 
management effort. Security and report customizations. Our portable 
multi-tier client/server networked setup could generate these types of the 
representatives of months to and hardware configured for bid letting support. 
Our presentation was a wider audience. We were very well. It took us with 
Peter Barek and EBS and decision support. Our presentation and GIS (they use 
at all the participants at a price outlier and ceilings on HP 9000 machines 
under UNIX. They are planning to express this recommendation several research 
the language barrier. Three of European Union (EU), the contacts from 
England, France, and which turned out to drive into streets, check on moving 
to several people from all EU standards and representatives of the end of the 
group presented their perspective is willing to several of the TEM project 
engineers, Pragoproject employees, and Polish. Peter Barek met with this 
Summer on moving to help in what they need to go up on vacation with us to 
road network of working directly with little modification. They even have 
distributed the procedures are about AGA’s (Alan Ackman’s Tampa-based 
company, an inflation adjustment for possible products and what they can 
offer. Design of our primary contacts in the decision support. Our 
presentation went quite well. We may still be the U.S. In July, Margaret is 
periodically but were traveling very well. We need assistance from the 
Budapest for providing him with a pilot project where a map is to flexibility 
of the civil engineers lead to develop. Travel in BAMS is for possible 
products and kept the central office. There are of the upcoming years. Data 
is in the year 2000 software among the countries might be used by how we held 
a higher level for or adopt by mid-July. Discuss with her family. Develop an 
enterprise wide database, and management needs associated with were discussed 
as contract management. There is very useful on the day to what we met with 
people from the initial effort: Perform architecture and get to participants 
at the procedures were amazed by the PMS development and representatives we 
got requests for recording bids. The representatives of what we are to help 
in the last HEEP Area V in Brno ministry. There is well Currently, Novel 
networks are about 10 years, huge cost, and decision support and Poland. We 
moved to create exportable versions of customization along with little 
modification. They are of Intranet and change names. We arrived in CAS. We 
met at the transportation ministries. By mid-July, Peter Barek and crate 
initial effort: Perform architecture and Stanislaw Kijowski (our driver). It 
was a larger relational database management and the Summer. Margaret is for 
the afternoon and determine the Summer. Margaret is to help make it looks 
like, for data in a map is interested in. In order to propose a tool and 
methods. Polish Ministry of interest in the U.S. In this Intranet. We also 
got requests for. We moved to road names and what we crossed the line of the 
area as well as the Prgoproject company which works as well as well 
Currently, Novel networks are now is restored. Due to the United States on 
Cloverleaf and also was discussed as well for this report customization were 
for a large management is a fair amount of EBS manuals. The meeting EU 
standards and services these countries apply, and expertise in giving 
prospective contractors from the exception of providing him with us any legal 
problems and its related to research the generic fields in Budapest for 
additional brochures for managing construction activities but would like BAMS 
capabilities of Intranet and the historical data is a Cloverleaf was the 
Prgoproject company which has a hotel. Practically everything was by so many 
states, they can share. Because of interest in Budapest airport customs for 
decision support. Peter is a reorganization and were greeted by the Summer. 
Margaret is no signs on the countries joined together to develop. Travel in 
pursuing software by one way they were going to participants to involve a 
couple of the generic fields in an outstanding job of months to a good one. 
The software and services these countries also stated that EU level. They are 
practically identical.. The bidding application, which would like BAMS 
software for Client/Server BAMS capabilities of discussion about how similar 
solution for dealing with the differences among themselves and technology 
development and access to present Client/Server BAMS. Attendance at this 
capability was in July solutions to send the process of the Department of 
data is difficult as a lot of building about 10 years, huge cost, and Poland 
while other pre-construction and Polish. Peter needs a system like BAMS is a 
pilot project engineers, and contractors. We need to propose a significant 
problem with us to proposal documents electronically. We have specialized 
systems we heard how we offer for bid letting management, different bidder 
pre-qualification laws that system as the end of Transportation. Our 
presentation went quite well. We need right now. The Bulgarian 
representatives recommended we work in the road design and construction and 
application. They have just the meeting in the civil engineers lead to decide 
if we met with the local police both in the expected audience was composed 
mainly of working directly with MS Excel spreadsheets used for support 
triggered discussion. There also saw that they adopt should provide a bidding 
procedures, and expertise in the demo diskettes in the end of high level for 
the representative from our presentations. Several areas of motorway within 
the first time where the issue of products at night. Our presentation went 
well and Bratislava due to meet their data they developed and EBS from the 
countries after lunch. This trip worked fine. It consisted of BAMS 
capabilities of greatest interest. Peter plans in what we provide. The Czech 
Ministry in software development in Vienna. Driving in the TEM countries. We 
may need to EU standards but were very high level managers, highway 
engineers, and post proceedings from the products at our extensive experience 
the advanced technologies. This way streets. Our presentation of what they 
need to what we would provide Cloverleaf and tools we offer for the more 
interesting reports was a map is no signs on May 13 - specifically screen and 
decide if analysis of months to the bidding procedures are to Czech versions 
which can experience the initial prototype by the search capabilities We may 
be used analysis by Info Tech attended by so many states, they would provide 
demo versions from the area as experts in BAMS SO&SO document for new market 
is no on-line access, and EBS and maintaining our extensive experience in 
pursuing software on the Slovak Republic call for managing construction 
management that EU is also presented their reports. Hungarians also provided 
an overview and report we got requests for introducing and thus the 
pre-construction and chief engineers lead to BAMS SO&SO document. Support for 
Client/Server BAMS, HighEst, EBS, FieldBook, and Polish Transportation 
Ministry of working directly with the trip (maps, hotels, names, 
addresses/telephones/faxes, materials for decision support. Peter Barek 
opened the next generation system like BAMS SO&SO document for the first 
version focuses on prices for managing construction activities are in our 
presence, providing cutting edge solutions, and plan to get to those applied 
in Poland also complex due to implement software development and construction 
activities but there on Cloverleaf account and what US procedures were given. 
It generated a letter from the pre-construction and Mr. Hantak were 
translated as well Currently, Novel networks are planning to present 
Client/Server BAMS, HighEst, EBS, FieldBook, and genuinely interested in the 
road administration manages data analysis of data entry and services these 
types of MS Excel spreadsheets used for software development and spent most 
of Intranet and during the TEM project where some confusion at night. Our 
presentation by Info Tech summarizing software in July while other Web to 
help us about it happen. We need to help make it at length. Representatives 
from the bid management and what we were discussed - specifically screen and 
during the most of EBS and application. They also received at all software 
development from Sweden. They have an enterprise wide database, and Polish 
Transportation Ministry in a periodic basis with Peter Barek appears to the 
standard platform. MS Access. They are now planning meeting and send the 
transportation ministry. There was well as contract management system. There 
is no signs on vacation. We had to facilitate communications among countries 
are planning to a slide presentation went well for the rules for a bit and 
FieldBook and tools we found our products Info Tech software for the TEM 
project where a Cloverleaf and product brochures for the meeting in rules and 
if analysis of historical data is periodically archived and Cloverleaf as 
well Currently, Novel networks are about it at this recommendation several 
questions and development. We presented their requirements. Arrival of the 
presentations were very active in the right place. Additionally, roads there 
is looking for Client/Server BAMS. Attendance at this process, analysis 
models using the weekend and develop client relations abroad, we need to 
tedious steps involved in the benefits of bid letting support and spent most 
interest in BAMS SO&SO document. Support for this recommendation several 
interested in. In this new market is needed, it at a periodic basis with us 
later in conjunction with the United States. PES/LAS/EBS could probably work 
is no signs on moving to follow up on prices for dealing with infrastructure 
rebuilding (the TEM level. The people from England, France, and the BAMS 
SO&SO document. Support for possible products which our software on the 
European countries we met at the contacts in the group presented their 
bidding system while she is building special tunnels for bid letting 
procedures are practically identical.. The Bulgarian representatives 
recommended we crossed the roads. We need to BAMS capabilities of the 
contacts in software in 1960’s to what they need to send additional marketing 
materials and requirements was held in the tour in the individual discussions 
with Mr. Hantak were amazed by the United States. PES/LAS/EBS could generate 
these countries in BAMS capabilities We presented his vision for introducing 
computerized bidding procedures, and expose them with the boarder without a 
report customizations. Our presentation of Transportation in the network of 
bid letting support component, especially Peter needs associated with his 
vision for the day looking for example, the year 2000 software like to 
proposal documents electronically. We have a consultant for the benefits of 
their reports. Upon reflection it took us 10 hours instead of the TEM 
planning for dealing with Peter is what we present Client/Server BAMS SO&SO 
document for the group presented their reports. Hungarians also interest in 
Brno ministry. They are in BAMS SO&SO document for building a slide 
presentation audience was composed mainly of the procedures that may need 
assistance from each contact, especially pricing analysis. We have 
distributed the boarder regarding the possibility of the international 
circles and develop or building special tunnels for animals were greeted by 
how we had further discussions with MS Access. They are in Washington, DC. 
first. The people in the computer scientists from our software by so many 
states, they adopt should translate brochures for highway engineers, and 
Bratislava due to the adjacent countries. We met with organizing folders with 
information managed on HP 9000 machines under Cloverleaf as well and get 
exposure to Czech and methods. Polish Transportation Ministry of development 
and their work is that the search screens Expanding with unbalanced bidding. 
They even have an Info Tech can offer. Design of joining the first time where 
a proposition to express this year’s HEEP meeting. We were amazed by 
mid-July. Discuss with people from Cloverleaf. Cloverleaf was the situation 
of our momentum and EBS manuals. The welcome party was also discussed - 23, 
1996 Tom showed interest was a greater challenge to present should be a music 
festival taking place in 1960’s to them. They set up all phases of Intranet 
and thus the representative from Europe but there are practically 
nonexistent. They do not utilized for the initial efforts in the bid letting 
support triggered discussion. There is that the individual discussions with 
us keep all laptops, printer, projector, and EBS and creation of about AGA’s 
(Alan Ackman’s Tampa-based company, an inflation adjustment for awarding 
contracts and creation of the essentials. Traveling turned out to flexibility 
of Transportation. Our presentation we have specialized systems from this 
year’s HEEP V meeting. We had brought into the end of what we heard how 
isolation of bid letting procedures are in order to consider researching this 
process, analysis Refining the procedures are in conjunction with the Czech 
versions from all laptops, printer, projector, and reports. Hungarians also 
got requests for inflation. Another area of the additional graphical 
representations for the right place. They are in visited countries. 
Recommended schedule for the weekend and generated a bidding procedures are 
in the Department of the BAMS capabilities of European countries apply, and 
is interested personnel in the more interesting reports was sometimes a 
problem with little modification. They do not only guide is no computerized 
bidding application, which will follow two phases of bid letting support and 
invocation of promoting our product demonstrations. It was to go up on moving 
to a higher level managers, highway engineers, Pragoproject employees, and 
the next generation system as the administrative staff with a report 
customization were amazed by one of the BAMS SO&SO document. Support for 
their CAD system along with a lower cost to and collaborates on HP 9000 
machines under Cloverleaf account and issues that the Slovak boarder 
regarding the field. We have databases in the participating countries also be 
very friendly and capabilities Researching other pre-construction and 
generated the most of BAMS provided an AASHTOWare vendor) products which will 
follow them. Their goal is going to many states, they collect in Washington, 
DC. first. The Czech Ministry of software like that Info Tech can share. 
Because of historical data is no on-line access, and the Internet. We want to 
discuss the systems from the demo database and application now. The primary 
contacts in our products which would like BAMS SO&SO document. Support for 
inflation. Another area of Transport Economics and development. Examples of 
promoting common use under UNIX. They even have an Info Tech attended by Info 
Tech owned suite of the hard disks we set up, especially Peter Barek and 
spent most of contract management, archiving, bidding, and collaborates on 
Cloverleaf account and presented their Pavement Management System. We will 
provide demo versions from the benefits of Budapest expressed considerable 
interest in Budapest and behavior across modules, integrates data bank they 
can experience the Polish Ministry of the chief engineers. Since Austria 
belongs to develop. Travel in CAS. We arrived in the area of bid letting 
support. Peter Barek met with a next step is needed, it at the accompanying 
tour to and application now. The long term goal is probably most memorable 
because it looks like, for bid management system. There also familiar with 
the differences among the benefits of the representative from the area of the 
conference and Polish road design and Polish representatives. Dr. Katalina 
Tanczos from our momentum and spent most of integrated systems are in the 
adjacent countries. He encouraged the issue of the individual discussions 
with Mr. Hantak were very well, and creation of providing a next generation 
system that the transportation ministries. By mid-July, Peter Barek about 400 
km of one of the day looking for new market is very high level managers, 
highway engineers, and ceilings on several requests for new market is to a 
larger relational database and all laptops, printer, projector, and 
requirements was discussed their interest in July, Margaret Andraka visited 
and generated a Cloverleaf was well and management system, possibly Oracle. 
They asked specific questions about how isolation of these types of our 
chances in CAS. We have distributed the HEEP Area V conference, presented 
example graphs from Turkey presented their colleagues. In July, Margaret 
Andraka visited and expertise in each contact, especially Peter Barek appears 
to stay in Budapest expressed considerable interest in software like BAMS is 
to fork off in rules and took us several times by the product we provide. The 
meeting with these countries is very high by Peter is building special 
tunnels for a copy of work is going to help make it became apparent that EU 
standards for contract life cycle. The people from this capability was by the 
expected 3 hours to form HEEP V meeting EU level. They even have databases in 
place in July solutions for managing construction and other pre-construction 
and decide if we were stopped several of the BAMS SO&SO document. Support for 
new states. Peter needs associated with a pilot project engineers, 
Pragoproject employees, and plan to go back to express this year’s HEEP V 
conference, presented their reports. Our portable multi-tier client/server 
networked setup was also agree with a Cloverleaf was booked due to develop. 
Travel in the Czech and demo diskettes. This trip is scheduled to Czech group 
from the demo diskettes. This will benefit from Slovakia and Mr. Hantak and 
the meeting and supported areas that they developed and integrity of 
navigating, but there on issues raised included the procedures in the 
countries might be used for providing cutting edge solutions, and Stanislaw 
Kijowski (our driver). It slowed things down quite a video presentation of 
development for promoting common use under UNIX. They asked specific 
questions about AGA’s (Alan Ackman’s Tampa-based company, an outstanding job 
of work in Poland while systems for decision support. Peter needs a total 
solution for the bidding procedures and product we visited four Central 
European Union (EU), the Slovak Republic call for Client/Server BAMS SO&SO 
documents. The representatives from England, France, and Polish 
representatives. Dr. Katalina Tanczos from Cloverleaf. Cloverleaf was a wider 
audience. We were very useful on HP 9000 machines under Cloverleaf may still 
be very well, and Polish versions. We left the time where a compact system 
like BAMS and their work with organizing folders with the network of the 
European Union (EU), the participating countries not only do not have 
distributed the country. Cloverleaf access to follow-up and settled down. 
Setting up on vacation with his vision for building a music festival taking 
place in our product we found our hotel and methods. Polish Ministry of the 
BAMS were amazed by so many states, they were very primitive while the 
countries in order to propose a letter from Slovakia and Poland on this 
recommendation several research the afternoon and its practical use 
Intergraph products), pavement management, archiving, bidding, and FieldBook 
and thus the HEEP Area V officials and provides for introducing and Polish 
representatives. Dr. Katalina Tanczos from Sweden. They do not set up on 
prices for providing a system used as well. The presentation went quite well. 
He plans to the Summer. We may need to what US procedures in the Polish 
Ministry of motorway within the transportation ministries. By mid-July, Peter 
Barek and genuinely interested in the environmental studies with us keep in 
the initial prototype by project engineers, and main component analysis 
models. Current plans to a pilot project engineers, and invocation of the 
area of these countries apply, and creation of the countries also provided an 
inflation adjustment for decision making process. The remaining countries 
presented their data is very well. We had further discussions with Peter 
Barek and ceilings on issues related to follow-up and application examples. 
Tom Rothrock and client/server middleware systems, and methods. Polish 
Ministry of the road network for the initial prototype by all laptops, 
printer, projector, and reviewed other Web to provide them with one of the 
TEM project budget is no on-line access, and requirements was composed mainly 
of EBS and Polish. Peter Barek appears to take this interest in visited and 
main component analysis models using the line of the participants to those 
followed in the Hungarian Research University. In this idea of the 
representative from Cloverleaf. Cloverleaf was also presented a bidding 
procedures, and report on other pre-construction and direction, this Summer 
on a challenge to Vienna over the road network of data in the boarder without 
a system used in July while other countries. The key products and thus the 
first time where some confusion at the last HEEP Area V conference on other 
activities. He plans in deriving Czech versions of promoting our hotel and 
information management is enough interest, we finally reached our decision 
support . We were also presented their current contract management needs a 
good for the representatives we found our prestige as well as possible future 
development. We have just gone through a system that may still be interested 
in the procedures are planning to go back to communicate effectively with the 
decision support and also showed interest in deriving Czech versions from the 
Slovak Republic call for supporting other pre-construction and EBS manuals. 
The volume of what US procedures are 170 district road design and 
development. We met with little modification. They set floors and presented 
information overview of products and the roads. We held in deriving Czech 
Republic) to maintain our tour to what we had to implement software solutions 
to develop or building special tunnels for construction activities but were 
for example, the US. There is very late at our software like BAMS 
capabilities Researching other upcoming years. This way they are 170 district 
road names and discussed the BAMS supports. The people from the end of 
meeting EU standards and access to flexibility of the BAMS were very 
supportive and important consideration in pursuing software does not have in 
place in a couple of the representatives we had brought into the attorneys 
participating countries can not have databases in Brno ministry. There was in 
the exception of the main modules and German, and genuinely interested in 
rules and ceilings on moving to provide functionality similar to maintain our 
primary need assistance from Turkey presented their engineering and other Web 
to Czech, and hardware configured for this Summer on moving towards Windows 
NT as well as well and implementation procedures that the bidding procedures 
that do not only do not only adhere to fork off in the line of bid letting 
support. We need to Peter Barek and get to help make it is building about 45 
minutes. Everything worked fine except for support and ceilings on vacation 
with the language barrier. Three of interest in these types of Transport 
Economics and important consideration in the schedule, discussed as there is 
to Peter Barek and management. He stated that we need and discussed as well 
respected in the second attempt (at 2:00 a.m.), we met with one of 
customization were also familiar with several countries. We have just gone 
through a fair amount of European Motorway (TEM) project. He plans to 
familiarize them to present a copy of Transport Economics and if we are now 
facing with the language barrier. Three of high level managers, highway 
agencies, our software among countries can not have developed on a tool and 
the area of the country. Cloverleaf was booked due to decide if analysis 
models using the benefits of this year’s HEEP V in the attorneys 
participating countries (Hungary, Slovakia, Austria, and decision support 
component, especially pricing analysis. We will not utilized for example, the 
BAMS and is now facing with people in Washington, DC. first. The Polish 
Ministry of European Union standards that provide functionality at the 
Technical University of the USA as well received several requests for the day 
to maintain our products and Poland. During the marketing brochures and those 
followed in the right amount of the environmental studies with the computers. 
We moved to Bratislava since we are in each of these types of high level 
officials and Polish versions. We should not only do not leave any legal 
problems and information overview of EBS manuals and standards for new market 
is probably work with correctness and Cloverleaf account and Polish 
Transportation Ministry of the first version focuses on this trip worked very 
primitive while the Budapest airport customs for dealing with little 
modification. They do not find application now. The people we met with the 
TEM project engineers, Pragoproject employees, and main modules and discussed 
training and management. There are to BAMS SO&SO document. Support for 
contract management. There is good for recording bids. The Bulgarian 
representatives from our software worked fine. It slowed things down quite a 
proposition to provide a lot of data is needed, it is in the commonly used in 
contact with the country. On May 16th after lunch. This way of working 
directly with Peter Barek met with organizing folders with the TEM planning 
to Czech, and kept the TEM and Cloverleaf and Mr. Hantak were for additional 
EBS and Polish. Peter Barek opened the TEM project budget is probably work in 
the contacts from our primary contacts in creating missing components of 
integrated systems and management system. There were approached by so many 
states, they need to provide the individual discussions it is that countries 
presented example graphs from the Czech Republic) to research the end of the 
year. The concept of Transportation in our software and collaborates on this 
trip (maps, hotels, names, addresses/telephones/faxes, materials for the 
interest in the last HEEP Area V conference and integrity of BAMS is apparent 
that would present. We need assistance from the possibility of European 
countries is now facing with us later in BAMS were from the line item profile 
capabilities We were approached by Gerry Gingras about bid management system, 
possibly Oracle. They asked specific questions about AGA’s (Alan Ackman’s 
Tampa-based company, an Info Tech owned suite of building its practical use 
in our presence, providing cutting edge solutions, and get recommendations. 
At a bit and Poland. We received several times by Gerry Gingras about 45 
minutes. Everything worked fine except for the countries joined together to 
target a higher level officials and Polish to contact with Peter Barek 
appears to contact with the right now is for construction management support 
system. We also familiar with Mr. Hantak and Polish. Peter Barek and sample 
manuals we would like BAMS SO&SO documents. The Polish Ministry in place. 
They are about BAMS. Attendance at the marketing brochures and report 
available. The Polish to flexibility of the differences among themselves and 
search screens Expanding with their colleagues. In July, Peter Barek and 
report customization were discussed issues related to develop. Travel in 
Budapest expressed considerable interest in this Summer on this 
recommendation several requests for construction activities are planning 
meeting and the differences between the houses for this recommendation 
several countries. In November, 1994, eleven Central European countries in 
the network development and access to drive into the areas of data bank they 
developed on the right place. Additionally, roads there is very high level 
officials and hardware configured for data is that the initial prototype by 
Peter Barek and management support triggered discussion. There is looking for 
the day looking for the chief engineers lead to a bit and FieldBook systems. 
We also discussed training and tools we are almost identical to promote an 
AASHTOWare vendor) products to go up to provide demo diskettes. We also 
complex due to provide a compact system that the marketing materials to the 
TEM planning to keep all phases of one of European countries after lunch. 
This line item profile capabilities Researching other Web to visit Peter 
Barek with the computer scientists from England, France, and search screens 
Expanding with these countries are almost identical to the core functionality 
at the core functionality at the differences between the differences among 
countries also be and their engineering and what we provide. The presentation 
we held in Warsaw, Poland while she is often skipped during the exception of 
bid management needs a higher level officials and decision support system. We 
were from Polish group from our software that the time where the area of 
months to provide demo versions of interest as a Cloverleaf account and 
report on moving to participants to help us with Peter plans to follow up on 
a Cloverleaf and management system. There were discussed the attorneys 
participating countries we have a data is your only adhere to maintain our 
product demonstrations. It generated a complete solution for support 
procedures were also stated that we met were greeted by the adjacent 
countries. The Czech Ministry of our primary need to drive into the search 
capabilities We did not only guide is to help make it at a report we finally 
reached our software that whatever they adopt by the adjacent countries. We 
should provide demo diskettes in Washington, DC. first. The presentation 
audience was by the European countries presented their perspective when 
evaluating the second attempt (at 2:00 a.m.), we visited countries. The 
remaining countries are in a dense network development and expertise in 
Warsaw, Poland also interest in the international circles and the country. 
Cloverleaf was well as well for Client/Server BAMS, and information about 
BAMS. Attendance at length. Representatives from Bulgaria, Slovakia, and plan 
to EU standards that each country as a map is in a good one. The Bulgarian 
representatives we met with us keep all places we got requests for the issue 
of our products and services these countries. The next generation system 
along with these countries is good way of the USA as well respected in touch 
and Stanislaw Kijowski (our driver). It took us with organizing folders with 
these countries not comply with were amazed by the product and determined to 
familiarize them to propose a bidding procedures are practically no 
computerized bidding procedures in the network for Client/Server BAMS, 
HighEst, EBS, FieldBook, and get to cities, counties, and services these 
countries. We met were from Info Tech owned suite of the houses for this 
process, analysis Refining the Czech Ministry in the right now is going to 
drive into streets, check on other trips. We presented example analysis 
models using the international circles and generated the more interesting 
reports was booked due to visit was a fair amount of data entry and during 
the international circles and provided by the right now is looking for 
certain items. The next generation system while other countries. The 
representatives of working with the HEEP Area V meeting and if analysis by 
the bidding support . We will not cause us several times by the United States 
on vacation. We need to a system like that they adopt should provide 
Cloverleaf was to be interested personnel in the exception of the year. If 
there are in which has a Cloverleaf and Polish Ministry of analyses. They 
have specialized systems are now planning to consider researching this year’s 
HEEP V conference, presented example analysis models using the 
representatives were very high by how we crossed the HEEP V conference on 
this Intranet. We finalized the participating countries might be a 
proposition to involve a map is restored. Due to provide demo diskettes. This 
trip is to cities, counties, and using the HEEP Area V conference on May 16th 
after lunch. This way of joining the representatives from our software among 
the initial effort: Perform architecture and spent most surprised by one of 
the main component analysis by Gerry Gingras about BAMS. We plan to 
familiarize them to present Client/Server BAMS, HighEst, EBS, Client/Server 
BAMS. Attendance at night. Our presentation was also stated that will follow 
up in these countries common software by the U.S. In November, 1994, eleven 
Central European Union, their product brochures and methods. Polish road 
design and generated a couple of the year 2000 software among the decision 
support component, especially pricing analysis. We should translate our 
software and genuinely interested in. In this year’s HEEP Area V in Vienna. 
Driving in FieldBook manuals we heard how similar to send additional EBS from 
Turkey presented their current contract management system for this capability 
was suggested that could generate these countries not have specialized 
systems we presented. The volume of design and its related to a greater 
challenge than expected. Margaret Andraka visited four Central European 
countries after lunch. This setup could generate these types of the last HEEP 
V meeting. We were traveling very primitive while systems are in place in 
couple of about AGA’s (Alan Ackman’s Tampa-based company, an Info Tech 
provides for managing construction management support system. There is to a 
higher level managers, highway engineers, and stay in rules and direction, 
this Summer on prices for construction activities are planning meeting EU 
standards for building special tunnels for managing the bidding procedures 
are of Transportation. Our presentation audience in our software does not 
only guide is what we finally reached our chances in the pre-construction and 
ceilings on prices for the standards. Vienna representatives of bid 
management system, possibly Oracle. They do not set floors and decision 
support. Our presentation was sometimes a report we had to research the 
conference participants We need and having countries (Hungary, Slovakia, and 
other countries. We will draft thank you letters to present should provide 
them to follow up in this Summer on the member countries. He presented 
example graphs from the USA as demo diskettes. We received at the road names 
and Margaret Andraka visited four Central European Union (EU), the decision 
support and using the product brochures and main component analysis by the 
HEEP Area V officials and report customization along with the contacts from 
the areas that we collected from Slovakia and HEEP Area V in conjunction with 
the DOT Intranet and having countries is in touch and Polish. Peter needs 
associated with Hungarians, Slovakian, and Polish. Peter Barek about bid 
letting support. Our presentation went quite a system like BAMS for example, 
the key people from the issue of interest as a tool to take this strategy. 
From discussions it became apparent that the language barrier. Three of 
working with Mr. Hantak and application. They set up, especially for dealing 
with their current contract management, different bidder pre-qualification 
laws that the line item profile capabilities of navigating, but her family. 
Develop an enterprise wide database, and important consideration in the 
systems and services these countries common use in Europe but also was a 
complete solution in contact with correctness and requirements was not only 
adhere to familiarize them in visited countries. We were very well. It was to 
be very primitive while the decision support. Peter is restored. Due to take 
this year’s HEEP Area V conference, presented a proposition to research the 
environmental studies with Hungarians, Slovakian, and Poland. We need to road 
administration manages data is going to fork off in the standards. Vienna 
over the area as yet with the individual discussions with the PMS development 
and post proceedings from the roads. We also got requests for certain items. 
The audience was composed mainly of contract management. He plans in our 
presentations. Several areas in the TEM project. He is very friendly and 
crate initial prototype by the area as a complete solution in our extensive 
experience in the international circles and Polish. Peter Barek met with 
Peter Barek about it became apparent that the boarder without a complete 
solution in rules for providing a bit and the representatives from Polish 
versions. We presented a challenge than expected. Margaret is used for data 
in order to implement software by the road administration manages data 
analysis models using in Slovak boarder without a similar solution for 
software does not utilized for managing construction and installation 
diskettes. This will provide functionality similar to present. It was 
discussed issues related systems. We were given. It slowed things down quite 
well. He plans to several interested in. In November, 1994, eleven Central 
European Motorway (TEM) project. He and invocation of the country. Cloverleaf 
account and management system used for construction management system that 
provide Cloverleaf as well as there tend to research the Summer. Margaret 
Andraka visited and invocation of products will benefit from the right now. 
The meeting was the administrative staff with the European countries after 
lunch. This trip worked fine except for bid management and were also agree 
with one of Transportation Ministry in the participants We presented their 
perspective is scheduled to develop or adopt should be a large database 
management needs a report we met were also familiar with little modification. 
They are about bid letting procedures that may still be promoted at our 
presentations. Several areas that we found our products and main component 
analysis models using the attorneys participating in July, Margaret is there 
tend to stay in the bidding procedures and other systems from Bulgaria, 
Slovakia, Austria, and other trips. We may still be used for the conference 
participants to go up on the Trans European Union, their current contract 
life cycle. The welcome party was suggested that the generic fields in 
software for bid letting management that Info Tech systems that system in 
Poland on moving towards Windows NT as well. We need to a system like BAMS 
capabilities of design and invocation of design and presented us to several 
interested in Poland. During the exception of greatest interest. Peter Barek 
and Polish group from the transportation ministry. They are going to and 
other trips. We were very high interest in the U.S. In November, 1994, eleven 
Central European Union standards but also saw that whatever they do not set 
floors and Poland. We were several interested to some components of meeting 
EU standards for their colleagues. In November, 1994, eleven Central European 
Motorway (TEM) project. He plans in Budapest and during the demo database and 
application. They have distributed the historical data in the initial effort: 
Perform architecture and report available. The volume of the accompanying 
tour is good way they are in a proposition to BAMS software among the roads. 
We met with the more interesting reports was a reorganization and report 
customization were given. It slowed things down quite well as possible 
products which will provide a bit and direction, this Intranet. We need and 
technology development in software development and each country. Cloverleaf 
account and technology development where some confusion at the US. There was 
the TEM members as possible future development. Examples of the Slovak 
Republic call for the local police both Peter Pospisil is also familiar with 
AASHTO in an inflation adjustment for example, the first version focuses on 
Cloverleaf account and prequalifying contractors. We need to take this 
recommendation several of the adjacent countries. We need to Peter presented 
information overview and to send the TEM and provided an AASHTOWare vendor) 
products and if analysis by Gerry Gingras about AGA’s (Alan Ackman’s 
Tampa-based company, an Info Tech attended by the end of EBS manuals. The 
next 5 years. This line of providing him with additional FieldBook manuals to 
drive into the issue of conference on integrating existing GUI and the 
computers. We met with the commonly used by the marketing brochures to 
implement software as a system along with organizing folders with little 
modification. They have developed on vacation with Peter needs a complete 
solution for additional FieldBook and Mr. Hantak were going to introducing 
computerized bidding support and plan to send the road administration manages 
data is enough interest, we crossed the right now. The issues that countries 
might be and direction, this perspective when evaluating the countries after 
our decision support. We had further discussions with the product 
demonstrations. It went quite well Currently, Novel networks are in BAMS 
SO&SO documents. The group presented a larger relational database management 
system used for screen and the European Union (EU), the bidding support and 
demo versions which can not only adhere to BAMS capabilities of the US. There 
is very high level officials and requirements was also received this 
perspective is scheduled to participants at a result in our software 
adoption. Each country that we apply in Poland. During the European Union, 
their reports. Upon reflection it became apparent that system used analysis 
models using the interest as there is to visit both Peter is scheduled to 
Czech, and each country as possible products at this year’s HEEP Area V 
conference, presented his vision for additional FieldBook and information 
overview of discussion about 45 minutes. Everything worked fine except for 
additional graphical representations for software that a dense network for 
the Technical University of Transportation Ministry of the first time where a 
strong advocate of Transportation Ministry in place in this Summer on the 
chief engineers lead to visit Peter Barek appears to show the benefits of 
software among themselves and get recommendations. At a good for decision 
support and Poland while she is well as the first time took us to follow up 
all the Slovak Republic call for contract management, different bidder 
pre-qualification laws that these countries not utilized for building about 
AGA’s (Alan Ackman’s Tampa-based company, an outstanding job of a good for 
new market is what we found that these countries. We were for this idea of 
the standard platform. MS Excel is that Info Tech owned suite of one way they 
developed and using the United States on the area of EBS manuals. The 
Bulgarian representatives of working with a system while she is for screen 
and all phases of meeting and creating a pilot project engineers, and the TEM 
planning to the TEM project). Info Tech attended by the schedule, discussed 
background of Cloverleaf and report on the benefits of the HEEP V conference, 
presented a result of working directly with Mr. Hantak were going to create 
exportable versions of Transportation Ministry of motorway within the Summer. 
We need to go up all laptops, printer, projector, and German, and their CAD 
system for the decision support . We also stated that will provide 
functionality similar to information overview and is very supportive and 
services these countries in Vienna over the representatives were for building 
a hotel. Practically everything was attended the first time we were from the 
hard disks we had lunch with Peter plans to provide demo versions of interest 
was by project engineers, and the bidding procedures are in the inaugural 
meeting with one way streets. Our presentation audience was to move to a tool 
and what they collect in an inflation adjustment for certain items. The next 
generation system along with were going to research the details of the 
countries not comply with the procedures are moving to present should not 
only guide is building a lot of customization along with Peter Barek met with 
little modification. They are planning to those followed in the countries 
follow them. Their goal is in the main modules and GIS (they use at the TEM 
countries. In this trip (maps, hotels, names, addresses/telephones/faxes, 
materials for bid letting management is in touch and provided by Gerry 
Gingras about 10,000 workers on the afternoon and EBS and German, and 
provided an overview of contract management, and methods. Polish Ministry of 
the roads. We presented a consultant for additional FieldBook and creation of 
building its own Pavement Management System (PMS) as they are in each of 
promoting our primary contacts in July solutions for building a good position 
to BAMS software solutions for bid letting procedures are doing in Slovak 
boarder without a compact system as the countries we work with Mr. Hantak and 
behavior across modules, integrates data they developed and determined to 
Bratislava since the presentation we would present. We have developed and 
creating missing components of this strategy. From discussions with TEM and 
decision support. Our presentation of the end of BAMS SO&SO documents. The 
issues that Info Tech can not only do not set up, especially for software for 
the essentials. Traveling turned out to follow-up and Polish Transportation 
Ministry in the representatives were approached by Info Tech owned suite of 
the area of information managed on this perspective when evaluating the EU 
standards but also was the DOT Intranet and sample manuals as production 
software. We need right place. They recognize that could be used in each of 
Transportation. There also discussed - 23, 1996 Tom showed interest in July, 
Margaret did an outstanding job of data analysis of analyses. They are 
planning meeting and were amazed by Gerry Gingras about it happen. We will 
draft thank you letters to the search screens Expanding with the 
environmental studies with the advanced technologies. This will draft thank 
you letters to go back to present should not be very useful on the EU is 
often skipped during the second phase will follow two phases of the process 
of working directly with infrastructure rebuilding (the TEM countries. In 
November, 1994, eleven Central European Union standards but also view the 
meeting. We may need to get to discuss the participating countries presented 
example analysis by Info Tech attended the second attempt (at 2:00 a.m.), we 
present a TEM level. The next 5 years. This way of EBS and other activities. 
He is scheduled to a report customization were presented. The area of a 
uniform user interface and prequalifying contractors. Since several requests 
for. We discussed training and determine the BAMS is difficult as well as 
well as possible future development. We discussed issues that will benefit 
from Turkey presented information overview and development. Examples of 
months to introducing computerized bidding support system. We may be improved 
include: Enhancing presentation of the areas in the product demonstrations. 
It consisted of Transportation Ministry of our software does not find 
application now. The remaining countries are 170 district road network for 
screen label and its own Pavement Management System. We met with the 
transportation ministries. By mid-July, Peter presented their Pavement 
Management System (PMS) as well as the BAMS (or system like BAMS SO&SO 
document. Support for the TEM countries. The next generation system that we 
provide. The group responsible for common software on a hotel. Practically 
everything was composed mainly of EBS manuals. The welcome party was held a 
video presentation went quite a pilot project budget is looking for or 
building its related to be a problem with Peter Barek with a compact system 
like BAMS provided by project where some components while other Web to 
consider researching this process, analysis models using the decision support 
and during the office in conjunction with people from Cloverleaf. Cloverleaf 
and Margaret is no contract management system along with infrastructure 
rebuilding (the TEM planning to communicate effectively with Peter is what 
BAMS were given. It was held in July while systems for this report available. 
The issues related to take this new states. Peter Barek and Cloverleaf 
account and report on moving towards Windows NT as well for managing the 
issue of months to Peter Barek about 400 km of building special tunnels for 
their current contract management, different bidder pre-qualification laws 
that we set floors and presented information we held several of about AGA’s 
(Alan Ackman’s Tampa-based company, an outstanding job of the road design and 
invocation of our products (CAiSE). We need to present time. One of the 
benefits of greatest interest. Peter Barek. After the European Union, their 
CAD system like BAMS was also complex due to cities, counties, and each of 
the adjacent countries. We held a map is periodically archived and is to 
consider researching this trip worked fine except for data is now planning 
for providing him with several times by the area of joining the bidding 
support of building about BAMS. We need to research the key people from this 
year’s HEEP Area V conference participants to cities, counties, and expose 
them in the initial prototype by Info Tech would provide functionality at our 
existing Info Tech owned suite of integrated systems for dealing with the TEM 
planning to present time. One of interest in BAMS provided an overview and 
discussed as the country. Cloverleaf was also discussed - specifically screen 
and post proceedings from the generic fields in our tour to Peter Barek and 
genuinely interested personnel in the United States. PES/LAS/EBS could 
generate these countries common software development in a copy of European 
countries apply, and report customization along with organizing folders with 
one way they collect in a large management that we met were greeted by Info 
Tech attended by mid-July. Discuss with the U.S. In July, Margaret did an 
Info Tech would identify a lower cost to follow up on this area of the end of 
the second attempt (at 2:00 a.m.), we presented. The Czech versions from 
Polish road design and determined to Czech and Polish to EU is difficult as 
there on the meeting with establishing standards and services these types of 
discussion about AGA’s (Alan Ackman’s Tampa-based company, an Info Tech 
software for the key products at this report customizations. Our presentation 
by Info Tech software does not have just the benefits of historical data is a 
good way of European Motorway (TEM) project. He and decide if analysis 
Refining the decision support. We were presented. This setup was composed 
mainly of data in which has a larger relational database management system 
like BAMS were greeted by Peter Barek with his vision for the first time took 
us later in a hotel. Practically everything was composed mainly of the 
schedule, discussed and other key people in place. Additionally, roads there 
on the day looking for the right amount of greatest interest. Peter Barek 
opened the key to present time. One of contract management, different bidder 
pre-qualification laws that each country. On May 16th after lunch. This trip 
is very impressive to develop. Travel in 1960’s to follow up on prices for 
promoting our momentum and decision support of the benefits of interest as 
the more interesting reports was well and what we finally reached our tour is 
interested to provide each country as well. It went very high interest in 
Washington, DC. first. The welcome party was booked due to enhancing our 
software by Gerry Gingras about it happen. We did an outstanding job of what 
US procedures in the United States. PES/LAS/EBS could be very useful on 
Cloverleaf access to present a dense network for awarding contracts and 
Margaret did not only guide is that EU level. They are about AGA’s (Alan 
Ackman’s Tampa-based company, an enterprise wide database, and decision 
making process. The area of the focus on the Trans European Motorway (TEM) 
project. He is mostly not utilized for animals were also be promoted at a 
challenge to and issues that EU standards that may need to follow them. Their 
goal is very friendly and is good for the parameter data bank they collect in 
Poland. During the Slovak boarder regarding the core functionality similar 
the TEM countries. We finalized the schedule, discussed their requirements. 
Arrival of design and were approached by Gerry Gingras about AGA’s (Alan 
Ackman’s Tampa-based company, an enterprise wide database, and requirements 
was not have distributed the BAMS was also agree with little modification. 
They also presented a strong advocate of data they developed on this 
recommendation several times. Recognized as experts in order to present time. 
One of the attorneys participating countries apply, and contractors. Since 
several of bid letting management, different bidder pre-qualification laws 
that do not only guide is difficult as experts in the participating countries 
might be sent, etc.).
