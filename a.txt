There is a new, updated active project list @ M:\projlist\projlist.doc. 
There have been so many addtions and deactivations since the last one
was published I'm not going to try to detail them all in this message. 
I suggest you review the list for project numbers of interest to you. 
The largest additions to the list are for the new AASHTO C/S project and
a new Texas contract.  The new Texas numbers begin 1047-.  The new
AASHTO C/S numbers begin 1107-, and have the client name AASHTO CLIENT
SERVER (instead of just AASHTO).

As a reminder, this list is most useful when you know the project number
and want to identify active tasks and subtasks.  If you don't know the
project number you s/b coding your time to, ask the person who assigned
you the work.  You can find your way to the number you're interested in
by using the Edit, Find command in Word.

If you see any errors or have any questions, please ask me or Gina.

Thanks,
Pat
